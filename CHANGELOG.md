# Changelog

All notable changes to TimeSh1t are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are git tags.

## [3.1.14] - 2026-06-30

- Holiday page now lists all holidays next to the calendar (date + name), so the dates are clearly visible regardless of the month shown; the calendar still marks each holiday day.

## [3.1.13] - 2026-06-30

- Fixed the Holiday calendar rendering blank: bundled the calendar library's own stylesheet (DaisyUI v4 does not auto-style it).

## [3.1.12] - 2026-06-30

- Fixed the Holiday calendar failing to load in the desktop app: the holiday data URL now points directly at the raw gist host (no cross-origin redirect, which the webview rejected).

## [3.1.11] - 2026-06-30

- Holiday page is now an interactive **calendar** (DaisyUI-styled Vanilla Calendar Pro) that highlights holiday dates with name tooltips, replacing the embedded PDF viewer. Dates are loaded at runtime from a remote JSON file, so the list can be updated without rebuilding the app.

## [3.1.10] - 2026-06-29

- Added a **Timeline** sidebar tab: archived timesheets laid out as a vertical, side-alternating timeline by month, each month showing an AI digest grouped by project tag. Digests are cached per month in a new `monthly_summaries` table (generated once on first view, with a per-month "Regenerate" button).
- Jira page: added a **My open tasks** button next to Run that lists your unfinished issues (assignee = currentUser, status not Done).

## [3.1.9] - 2026-06-29

- Jira setup now detects a Claude CLI installed via nvm/Homebrew when launched from the GUI app (PATH no longer needs manual linking in common cases).

## [3.1.8] - 2026-06-25

- Archived search is now hybrid: short/acronym queries (e.g. "SIT") use keyword matching, while multi-word phrases use semantic vector search — fixing irrelevant results like "SICK leave" matching "SIT".
- Friendlier login error when a non-provisioned email requests a setup code ("No account found for this email. Ask your admin to add you first.").

## [3.1.7] - 2026-06-25

- Added a first-time account setup flow on the login screen: provisioned users can email themselves a 6-digit code and choose their own password (no web build or deep linking required).

## [3.1.6] - 2026-06-25

- Added a monthly timesheet-cutoff warning in the sidebar (above the online list) that appears on the 25th of each month.

## [3.1.5] - 2026-06-25

- Copy-success feedback now shows as a non-intrusive bottom-right toast on the timesheets and archived pages, instead of an inline banner that shifted the table layout.

## [3.1.4] - 2026-06-25

- Added a quick-copy AI summary button next to the row actions in the timesheets table.
- Temporarily hid the "Mark done + close Jira" action while the Jira close flow is being finalized.

## [3.1.3] - 2026-06-25

- Removed the "developed by thiti_t and claude" page footer.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-06-25

- **Update banner fit:** the sidebar "Update" banner no longer overflows the 192px sidebar — shorter label plus truncation.
- **Real release notes:** the update dialog (and GitHub release) now show the actual changelog for the version instead of the generic "See the assets…" placeholder. The release workflow pulls notes straight from CHANGELOG.md.
- **Footer:** "developed by thiti_t and claude" on every page.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-06-25

- **Windows:** no more `cmd` console windows flashing when the app calls `claude` (status checks and Jira actions now spawn with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-25

- **General Jira assistant:** the Jira tab now does anything the Atlassian MCP supports — create issues, edit summary/description, add comments, assign, query ("what's assigned to me?"), as well as transition status. (Previously limited to "transition to Done".)
- **Searchable project picker:** the new-entry modal's project field is now a type-to-search combobox (native datalist) instead of a long scroll-only select.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-25

Jira integration and in-app update notifications.

- **Jira tab:** mark work done in Jira from inside TimeSh1t, driven by your local Claude Code CLI + the Atlassian MCP — no Jira token is stored in the app. The tab gates on setup (install Claude Code → add the Atlassian MCP at user scope → authenticate) and only shows the usage panel once `atlassian` reports **Connected**.
- **"Mark done + close Jira"** per-row action: flips the timesheet `is_complete` in-app (RLS-safe) and asks Claude to transition the matching Jira issue to Done. The two steps are independent — the timesheet still completes if Jira isn't set up.
- **Live progress:** Claude's steps (which tool it's calling, its reasoning) stream into the UI instead of one opaque spinner.
- **Update banner:** on launch, the sidebar shows an "Update available" banner under the online-users list; clicking it opens the release notes with one-click download-and-install.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-23

Semantic search, autofill, and AI Q&A over your archived timesheets, powered by
Supabase pgvector + Cloudflare Workers AI embeddings (bge-m3, multilingual).

- **Archived → Search:** find past entries by meaning, not keywords (Thai + English).
- **Autofill:** new entries suggest similar past descriptions as you type.
- **Ask tab:** ask natural-language questions about your history; answers cite the entries they used.
- Archived entries are embedded automatically on page open; an "Index archive" button backfills the initial bulk.

Requires a one-time Supabase migration (pgvector + `match_archived_timesheets`) and the
updated Cloudflare Worker (`embed` + `chat` routes).
